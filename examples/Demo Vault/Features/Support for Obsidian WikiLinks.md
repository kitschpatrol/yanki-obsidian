Support for Obsidian WikiLinks

---

Jump back to sources in Obsidian while studying in Anki.

The Yanki plugin detects your vault's name, and automatically turns any internal `[[WikiLinks]]` in your notes into `obsidian://` protocol links, which you can click through in Anki to get back to the source in Obsidian.
