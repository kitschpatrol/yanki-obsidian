**Cloze with advanced numbering**

By default, clozes are numbered incrementally.

In some cases you might want to take control over cloze numbering â€” perhaps you want to ~~1 reveal~~ multiple ~~1 clozes~~ simultaneously on a single card, or ~~2 group~~ certain ~~2 clozes~~ together on a ~~3 particularly _adverb_~~ cloze-heavy ~~3 note _noun_~~.
