By default, multiple clozes in the same note are numbered incrementally.

However, ~~1 Manual~~ cloze numbering can be accomplished by adding a ~~1 one or two digit _how many digit_~~ number to the front of the `~~cloze~~` like this: `~~1 cloze~~`

The syntax has some room for forgiveness, as well:

~~1 this works~~

~~1) this works~~

~~(1) this works~~

~~1. this works~~

~~|1| this works~~

~~1| this works~~
