Intelligent syncing

---

Your local Obsidian Markdown notes are the single point of truth for what will end up in Anki, but Yanki knows to leave your other Anki notes alone.

When you edit a local Obsidian note, Yanki makes every effort to update rather than delete it in the Anki database so that review progress is preserved.

But when you do want to delete something, it's as simple as deleting it from Obsidian, and it will be removed from the Anki database on the next sync. Protections are in place to prevent deleting Anki notes that weren't initially created by Yanki.

If you use [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/) to sync your notes to the cloud, Yanki will also trigger this next step in the sync, automating the flow from Markdown → Anki → AnkiWeb in one shot.
