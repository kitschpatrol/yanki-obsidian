Media asset sync

---

Yanki can sync images, videos, and audio files embedded in your Obsidian notes to Anki's media asset management system. At your option, it can sync local assets, or assets linked via URL, or both, or none.

Yanki automatically manages clean-up of synced media assets in Anki when you delete your Obsidian notes, or when specific assets are removed from your Obsidian notes.

Both wiki-style `![[something.png]]` and `![markdown](style.png)` asset embedding syntaxes are supported.

For example, local assets:

Wiki style...

Or Markdown style...
